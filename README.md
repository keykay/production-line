# ProductionLine

This project exemplifies some of the concepts of working with Observables and RxJS operators. It is built around the idea of a manufacturer's production line, where you have a set of materials being manipulated and combined in order to produce a sort of manufactured product. This is part of a series of Angular Workshops I've doing with my team. The goal of the workshops is to improve the team's skills in Angular and Spring, technologies that will be used in the new projects.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
